Project Name:- Symptom Tracker

Project Purpose
This project focuses on helping people with common lifestyle diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure (BP). 
These diseases are becoming more common and are a major reason for many health problems around the world.
Many people, especially elderly ones, find it difficult to go to hospitals or labs often for regular health checks. It also takes a lot of time and money.
This project provides a simple way for users to check their health at home. It helps them stay aware of their condition and can support early detection. Early action can lead to better health and lower risk.

Code Walk through
The program asks users to enter:
1) Blood sugar level before meal
2) Blood sugar level after meal
3) Systolic and diastolic blood pressure values
Using this data, the code checks the input values and gives a severity level (like normal, moderate, or high).
 This helps users understand how serious their condition might be and whether they should take action or consult a doctor.

Future Scope
1. The main concept is to make health monitoring more accessible, especially for the elderly, by allowing them to easily track their health at home. 
2. This tool aims to save both time and money, offering a simple way for users to check vital health levels like blood sugar and blood pressure without needing to visit a clinic.
3. By inputting their data into the system, elderly individuals can receive quick feedback, empowering them to stay on top of their health from the comfort of their home.
